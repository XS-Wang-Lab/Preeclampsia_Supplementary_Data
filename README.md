## Repository Contents

### Tables
- **Table S1** – Placental cell types and their marker genes  
  Lists nine major placental cell types along with representative marker genes, used to annotate and classify cells in the single-cell RNA-seq dataset.

- **Table S2** – Trophoblast cell subtypes and their marker genes  
  Provides marker genes for five trophoblast subtypes, supporting the identification, characterization, and distinction of trophoblast populations.

- **Table S3** – UPLC-MS/MS quantitative metabolomics results  
  Contains absolute and normalized metabolite levels across plasma samples.

- **Table S4** – Identified metabolites after normalization and quality control  
  Lists all metabolites retained following preprocessing steps, ensuring high-quality input for analyses.

- **Table S5** – Differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) between PE and normal controls  
  Displays metabolites with significantly altered abundance in PE patients relative to controls.

### Figures
- **Fig S1** – Pseudotime expression of external trophoblast subtype marker genes  
  Smoothed expression profiles of externally curated marker genes for villous cytotrophoblasts (VCT), extravillous trophoblasts (EVT), and syncytiotrophoblasts (SCT) along the inferred pseudotime trajectory.
